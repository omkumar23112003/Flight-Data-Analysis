✈️ Flight Data Analysis with Python, MySQL & Power BI

[![Python 3.9+](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.9+-blue://img.shields.io/badge/Database BI](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visualization-Power: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg Jupyter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Jupyter 📢 Overview

This Flight Data Analysis project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics pipeline—from raw flight datasets, through database design and management (MySQL), data cleaning and ETL (Python), to rich interactive dashboards (Power BI).

It’s designed for aviation industry analytics, helping uncover business insights like busiest routes, flight punctuality, passenger patterns, and operational bottlenecks.

🎯 Objectives
Data Integration: Bring raw datasets into a structured MySQL environment.

Analysis-ready Data: Clean, filter, and join data for analysis via Python.

Interactive Visuals: Build dashboards giving insights for stakeholders.

Scalability: Easy to extend for new data sources or analytics needs.

🔄 Workflow
1. Data Ingestion
  ↳ Import raw CSV/excel datasets

2. MySQL Database Setup
  ↳ Create schema & tables (Airport_Normal_Questions.sql, Airport_Challenging_Questions.sql)

3. Python ETL / Analysis
  ↳ Use Pandas + MySQL connection to clean, transform, and generate aggregates

4. Reporting & Dashboarding
  ↳ Load aggregated data into Power BI for interactive visuals
